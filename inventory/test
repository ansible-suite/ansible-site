### The inventory file for testing machines
# This file can be filled with groups and hosts in the INI or YAML formats,
# or it can be replaced by a directory containing different (possibly dynamic) inventory sources,
# or it can be removed, if testing environment is not used.
# For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html
