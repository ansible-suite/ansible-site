## Installs Ansible collections and roles using Ansible Galaxy
# Performs the following actions:
#   - for this run, overrides collections and roles install path 
#     to 'external_roles' and 'external_collections', respectively
#   - installs and/or upgrades Ansible collections from 'requirements.yml'
#   - reinstalls Ansible roles from 'requirements.yml',
#     as upgrading what has changed is not possible
#   - if current environment's venv is active, calls 'install-pip-deps'
#     to install PIP dependencies required by collections and roles


## Activate the project environment
source "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")/activate"


## Define variables
requirements="$project/requirements.yml"


## Override collections and roles install path
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH="$project/external_collections"
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH="$project/external_roles"


## Install collections and roles

# install collections
ansible-galaxy collection install -r "$requirements" --upgrade

# install roles
ansible-galaxy role install -r "$requirements" --force


## Install PIP dependencies of collections and roles

# check if current environment's venv is active
if [[ "$VIRTUAL_ENV" = "$venv" ]]; then

    # calls 'install-pip-deps' to install PIP dependencies
    # of collections and roles
    install-pip-deps
